**Kivy** - Open source Python library for rapid development of applications
that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps.

## Instalation

This project is build for the Raspberry Pi. Other platforms should be working too but we promise anything. This project depends on Python 3.5 and with the latest Kivy version installed.

If you want to know how to install Kivy. [Click the link here](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-rpi.html) and change the lib versions to python3 like so: "python-setuptools" to "python3-setuptools" and "python-dev" to "python3-dev".
